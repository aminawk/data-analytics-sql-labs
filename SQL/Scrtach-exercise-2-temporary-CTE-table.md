# Q: Calculates the difference between the highest salaries in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the absolute difference in salaries.
## Note - steps in Sql are : Join → Sort → Formula → Filter

--- Here is the first part of the codde joining the table. The next part would involve finding the salary but it can be hard to do when the code becomes long without breaking it. So an alterantive is to save the output to a tempory CTE table.

```sql
SELECT 
a.department_id,
a.first_name,
a.id,
a.last_name,
a.salary,
b.department

FROM db_employee AS a
LEFT JOIN db_dept AS b
ON a.department_id = b.id


### Saving to a tempory CTE:
```sql
WITH employee_dept AS ( --tempory table employee_dept
    SELECT
        a.department_id,
        a.first_name,
        a.id,
        a.last_name,
        a.salary,
        b.department
    FROM db_employee AS a
    LEFT JOIN db_dept AS b
        ON a.department_id = b.id
)

SELECT *
MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employee_dept
GROUP BY department;
